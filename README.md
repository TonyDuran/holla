# Holla
A Nostalgic throwback to chatting with friends/family. This project was part of a system design discussion we had in our SASD meetup. Design AOL Instant Messanger as if it were built today. We only came up with a design for how we would build and scale the instant messanger application.

However, I decided I would like to attempt actually implement our design. So this project is simply an exercise to help me learn/reinforce concepts I know.


## Plan
I plan to leverage k8s to handle scale and containerize the main components to our design. This will most likely be overkill, but this is a learning exercise.
